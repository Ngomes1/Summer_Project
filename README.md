# Summer_Project
This Project is an old file created by me and my mentor Nicolas-Choquette-Levy who assisted in finding correlations between various variables.
This project was created using the Jupyter Notebooks off of the anaconda compiler at the time. It was my first project so it is definitely hard to read and far more disorganized then it should have been.
The Nempal_Temp file was an attempt to merge a differing data set collected by a set of radars that recording monthly precipitations and temperatures in roughly the same area as Chitwan Valley sample study data that was collected by a scientist and his team.This data was collected using the CRUdata website.
The Summer project file was the notebook we worked on cleaning and using the data that would either support or in our case alter our hypothesis on the affects of global warming, outward migration (which actually helped crop production due to the influx of remitance/ money sent back home) 
Summer Project word file was the ending result report concluding the summer REU and  conducted using various resources listed there in.
